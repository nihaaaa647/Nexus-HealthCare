Goal: Design a complete, high-fidelity mock-up and detailed technical architecture for a Patient-Centric Clinical Workflow and Coordination System (PCCWCS). This system must resolve fragmented communication and delayed updates in hospital patient care by focusing on real-time visibility and structured departmental coordination around a single patient record.Part 1: Context and Core Requirements

Project Name and Context: The system is being developed for the VNRVJIET AI-WEEK VIBE CODING HACKATHON (KRITHOMEDH). The core problem is the fragmentation of clinical workflows (manual requests, scattered information, delayed updates).1

System Focus: The focus is strictly on patient-wise visibility, structured clinical workflows, and seamless coordination between departments, not building a full hospital management system (HMS).2

Mandatory User Roles: The design must accommodate specific, distinct user interfaces for:

Doctor: The primary initiator of all actions.3

Nurse/Ward Staff: The primary implementer of care instructions and vital status updater.

Diagnostic Unit (Lab/Imaging): The processor and updater of diagnostic results.4

Pharmacy: The processor and updater of medication requests.4

Core Requirement (Real-Time Visibility): Updates from any stakeholder (nurses, diagnostics, pharmacy) must be immediately visible to all others involved in the patient's treatment. The system must clearly show which actions are Completed, In-Progress, or Pending.2

Part 2: Detailed UI/UX Specifications and Mockup Outline



Generate a detailed outline of the three most critical screens, detailing every major component:

Screen 1: The Patient Record Dashboard (PRD)

Header: Must display Patient Name, ID, Attending Physician, and a prominent, color-coded Overall Patient Status (derived from the status of the most critical pending action).

Primary Component: Clinical Action Timeline: A reverse chronological feed organized around the single patient record. Each entry must clearly state:3

Initiator (e.g., Dr. Smith).

Action Type (e.g., Prescription, Diagnostic Request).3

Target Department (e.g., Pharmacy, Lab).

Real-Time Status Tag: Use distinct visual indicators (color/icon) for Pending, In-Progress, or Completed.2

Side Panel: Quick links for the Doctor to initiate new actions (Prescription, Diagnostic, Referral, Care Instruction).3

Screen 2: Doctor Interface (Action Initiation View)

Design the user flow for initiating a Diagnostic Request. Detail the necessary fields (Test Type, Urgency Level, Clinical Notes).

Show how the Doctor views their personal list of assigned patients, highlighting those with critical pending updates or unreviewed diagnostic results.

Screen 3: Departmental Queue (e.g., Pharmacy View)

Design the queue structure: A list of all incoming tasks for that department (e.g., all Pending prescriptions).

Define the interaction flow: Show the button sequence for a Pharmacist to move an item from Pending $\rightarrow$ In-Progress (Acknowledged) $\rightarrow$ Completed (Dispensed), and how this change is instantly reflected on the Patient Record Dashboard.

Define the backend state machine for a 'Clinical Action.' Specify exactly which database triggers or Edge Functions are required to notify the Doctor's UI when a Pharmacy status moves to 'Completed'

Part 3: Technical Architecture and Technology Stack

Required Technical Stack Recommendation: Propose a modern "vibe coding" stack optimized for a hackathon's speed and real-time needs (e.g., Next.js, Supabase/Firebase, PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS). Justify the choice based on its ability to rapidly deliver the real-time visibility requirement.

Real-Time Mechanism: Detail how the requirement for "immediately visible" updates will be technically achieved (e.g., using WebSockets/Socket.io or a managed service like Supabase Realtime). Explain how a status change in the Pharmacy system instantly triggers an update on the Doctor's screen.2

Data Modeling (Simplified): Outline the minimal necessary database tables and their key relationships to achieve the core goal:

Patient

User (with Role: Doctor, Nurse, etc.)

Action (Must link back to one Patient and track Status and Target_Department).

Provide the SQL DDL for the actions table, ensuring it includes a JSONB field for metadata (to handle varying requirements between Pharmacy and Lab) and a priority_level enum.

Part 4: Advanced Features (The "Stretch Goals")



The initial scope focused on coordination. Add these advanced features to demonstrate superior workflow management and efficiency:2

Smart Prioritization: The system automatically assigns a priority (P1/P2/P3) to any new Doctor Action based on a keyword analysis of the instruction (e.g., detecting "STAT" or "ASAP"). This priority then dictates the order tasks appear in the departmental queues.

Clinical Safety Check: Implement a non-blocking alert system. If a Doctor inputs a prescription that conflicts with a known patient allergy or another high-dose medication already ordered, a soft warning is displayed before the request is finalized.

Embedded Departmental Chat: Add a persistent, context-aware chat tied to the Patient Record. This allows a Nurse to instantly query the prescribing Doctor about a specific Pending care instruction without leaving the patient's timeline view.

Handoff Summary Generation: On command, the system aggregates all Pending and In-Progress actions over a specified time period (e.g., the last 8 hours) into a printable summary, designed for nurse shift changes.

Add a 'Clinical Insights' feature: Use an LLM to summarize the 'Action Timeline' into a 3-sentence 'Condition Brief' for the Doctor, highlighting any bottlenecks where a 'Pending' action has exceeded a 2-hour threshold

Part 5: Expected Output Format

For each screen, specify the 'Visual Cues' (e.g., use #ef4444 for P1 Emergency tasks) and suggest a layout that minimizes 'click-fatigue' for high-stress environments like a nursing station.

Provide the response using the following structure:

Summary of Proposed Stack & Real-Time Strategy.

UI/UX Design Outline (Screens 1, 2, 3) presented in markdown tables for clarity.

Detailed Implementation Plan for Advanced Features (Smart Prioritization, Clinical Safety Check, Embedded Chat, Handoff Summary).
