# 🏥 Nexus — Patient-Centric Clinical Workflow System

> **Real-time visibility. Structured coordination. Zero communication gaps.**

Nexus is a **Patient-Centric Clinical Workflow and Coordination System (PCCWCS)** built for the **VNRVJIET AI-WEEK VIBE CODING HACKATHON (KRITHOMEDH)**. It tackles the #1 cause of preventable medical errors — **fragmented communication between hospital departments** — by unifying all clinical actions around a single, real-time patient record.

---

## 🔥 The Problem

In most hospitals today:
- 📋 Doctors write prescriptions on paper → Pharmacy receives them hours later
- 🧪 Lab results sit in a queue → the attending physician is never notified
- 🩺 Nurses implement care instructions → but no one tracks completion
- 🔄 Shift handoffs rely on verbal summaries → critical tasks get lost

**Result:** Delayed treatment, redundant tests, and patient safety risks.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

Nexus provides a **unified, role-based dashboard** where every clinical action — prescriptions, lab requests, nursing tasks — flows through a **real-time action pipeline** visible to all stakeholders.

| Before Nexus | After Nexus |
|---|---|
| Scattered paper trails | Single patient timeline |
| "Did pharmacy get my order?" | Live status: Pending → In-Progress → Completed |
| Verbal shift handoffs | Structured clinical notes with author logs |
| No task prioritization | Smart P1/P2/P3 priority queues |

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧑‍⚕️ Role-Based Dashboards
Five distinct interfaces, each optimized for the user's workflow:

| Role | Dashboard Highlights |
|---|---|
| **Doctor** | Patient list, pending requests, quick actions (Prescription, Diagnostic, Nursing, Notes) |
| **Nurse** | Priority-sorted care tasks, add custom tasks, mark completion |
| **Pharmacy** | Prescription queue with status pipeline |
| **Lab** | Diagnostic request queue with result updating |
| **Receptionist** | Patient admission form, full hospital census |

### 📊 Patient Record Dashboard
- **Clinical Action Timeline** — reverse-chronological feed of all actions for a patient
- **Color-coded status tags** — Pending (amber), In-Progress (blue), Completed (green)
- **Priority badges** — P1 Critical (red), P2 Urgent, P3 Routine
- **Quick Actions** — one-click Prescription, Diagnostic, Nursing, and Notes creation

### 📝 Clinical Notes with Author Logs
- Any role can add timestamped notes to a patient record
- Each note shows **author name**, **role badge**, and **relative timestamp**
- Full audit trail — who said what and when

### 🔄 Real-Time Departmental Coordination
- Doctor initiates action → appears instantly in the target department's queue
- Department updates status → reflected on the patient timeline
- Cross-departmental visibility — no action falls through the cracks

### 🏥 Patient Management
- Admit patients with severity classification (Critical / Urgent / Stable)
- Assign attending doctors
- Server-persisted patient records via REST API
- Allergy tracking and room assignment
